# foundation - Data X Fall 2018

## Overview

Many people who enjoy going to the gym wish to improve their technique, but there are many inconveniences to doing so. Most people either don’t want to risk injury from self-teaching from the internet, don’t want to pay and organize a schedule for a personal trainer, or deal with the glitchiness associated with consulting a trainer remotely. Foundation seeks to remedy this problem by providing an accurate, easy to use, and cost-effective way for the average gym goer to receive feedback on their lifting form.
